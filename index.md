# Welcome to click on Xia Zeyu's personal financial resume to share

This is my personal website for my unique insights into investing, market analysis, and financial strategies.

## About me
I am a student who is passionate about finance, and I am a student of Lingnan Convergence Technology this year, with a bachelor's degree in finance, and I have a unique and special understanding of finance, especially combined with computer technology in the new era.
## My financial style
My understanding of investing is based on the following key principles, which I would recommend if I were an investor:

1. **Value Investing**: I focus on finding quality companies that are undervalued by the market and gaining capital appreciation through long-term holding.
2. Risk Diversification: I diversify my investments across multiple sectors and asset classes to reduce the risk of volatility in a single market or industry.
3. Macroeconomic Analysis: Before making an investment decision, I first consider global macroeconomic changes and understand their potential impact on various types of assets.
4. Solid returns: I pursue long-term solid returns, not short-term speculation.

As a beginner in finance, I gradually realized the importance of financial statements. Although it was not easy for me to read these reports at first, through repeated study and research, I found that they can clearly reflect a company's operating conditions and market performance.

I like to gain insight into the financial health of a company by reading its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Especially when evaluating a company's profitability and growth potential, the key data in the report provides a very valuable reference. For example, changes in revenue, profit growth trends, and the stability of cash flow can all reflect a company's competitiveness in the market.

## Portfolio
I think people's portfolios span multiple sectors, including technology, finances, consumer goods, and healthcare, among others. I focus on growth, financially healthy companies that are held for the long term to add value.
